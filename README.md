PROJECT TITLE: AI-Based Product Recommendation System

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

As a part of my 8-week internship at CodTech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I worked on developing a smart recommendation system using Java and Apache Mahout. The aim of this project was to build a system that could suggest products to users based on their preferences and the preferences of users with similar behavior. This type of recommendation system uses collaborative filtering to generate personalized suggestions, commonly used in e-commerce, media, and content-based applications.

The system was implemented in Java and used Apache Mahout to handle the machine learning logic. The recommendations are generated by identifying users with similar interests and recommending items that those users have liked or rated highly.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Java: The programming language used to implement the application logic.

Apache Mahout: A scalable machine learning library used to calculate user similarities and generate recommendations.

Maven: Used for project management and dependency handling.

SLF4J and Logback: Used for logging during application development.

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA was used for writing, building, and testing the application.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

The project follows a Maven structure with the following main components:

RecommendationEngine.java: The main Java class where the recommendation logic is written.

dataset.csv: A CSV file containing user ID, product ID, and rating, which acts as the input dataset.

pom.xml: The Maven configuration file that lists the required dependencies.

FOLDER STRUCTURE:

RecommendationSystem/
├── data/
│ └── dataset.csv
├── src/
│ └── main/
│ └── java/
│ └── RecommendationEngine.java
└── pom.xml

HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS:

Data Loading:
The program starts by reading the dataset (dataset.csv), which contains entries in the format:
UserID, ProductID, Rating
Example:
1, 101, 4.5
1, 102, 3.5

This data is loaded into a DataModel using Apache Mahout's FileDataModel class.

Similarity Measurement:
User similarity is calculated using the Tanimoto Coefficient, which compares the ratings of items between users to determine how similar they are.

Defining Neighborhood:
The system selects the 5 users most similar to the current user (nearest neighbors). This is done using Mahout's NearestNUserNeighborhood class.

Generating Recommendations:
Based on the preferences of similar users, the system generates a list of top recommended products using Mahout’s GenericUserBasedRecommender class.

Product Name Mapping:
Each product ID is mapped to a human-readable name such as "Bluetooth Speaker", "Phone Charger", etc., for better clarity in output.

Displaying Results:
The final output shows the recommended products for a specific user along with a score that indicates the strength of the recommendation.
Example:
Product Recommendations for User 1:

Bluetooth Speaker (Score: 4.8)

Phone Charger (Score: 4.5)

SETTING UP AND RUNNING THE PROJECT:

Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Make sure Apache Maven is installed and configured.

Place the dataset.csv file inside the data/ directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project root folder.

Use the following command to compile and run the application:
mvn clean compile exec:java

The application will load the dataset, process it, and display product recommendations for a selected user.

CONCLUSION:

This project provided a solid understanding of how collaborative filtering can be implemented using Java. I learned how to integrate Apache Mahout into a Java application to build a recommendation engine that can be scaled and extended. The system demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be applied to personalize user experiences by suggesting relevant items based on behavioral data. The knowledge gained through this project will be highly useful for developing intelligent systems in real-world applications like shopping platforms, movie recommenders, and other content-driven services.
